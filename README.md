[How the iPhone 14 Pro's New 'Dynamic Island' Works](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island/)

Apple recently announced their new iPhone 14 Pro smartphones. One of the biggest changes is the removal of the notch; now, the iPhone has a pill and hole-punch shaped cutout at the top of the display. While I was skeptical when I was reading the rumors, a new hardware/software feature mix called *Dynamic Island* makes the most of that space.

*Dynamic Island* is an interactive space that allows for multi-tasking, live alerts, and more. One of the most impressive aspects of the feature is its adaptibility. The size of the *Dynamic Island* changes depending on the type of notification being shown. For instance, your running timer indicator will slink away seamlessly when you get a phone call. In my opinion, it's one of Apple's biggest engineering feats in years.

This was really interesting to read! I am also a bit skeptical about this change, as I believe it looks more like a sumsung product more than anything now, I am more open to this new Dynamic Island space. While I am not planning on getting the Iphone 14, learning about how their developments and features have improved over time is something I regularly do.

I agree, I'm actually a big fan of *Dynamic Island*! From a design perspective, I think the shape, color, and position of it is in a predictable enough place where it won't catch the user too off guard but also does something so new and dynamic that it feels fresh.

Oh wow! After reading the article, I'm starting to consider switing from Android to Apple. The new up and coming changes I have been hearing about Apple products have been really enticing! The *Dynamic Island* sounds user friendly and much better than the current notification system on my Android phone to be honest. The adaptability, specifically the transition between notifs, is very appealing!
